class TreePicker(object):
    """ Iterator for picking the most distant leaves in tree-like structures

    When the value is returned by the iterator, each edge forming the path
    to the corresponding leaf node gets its weight increased, therefore
    all the nodes that are in the same subtree as the selected node get
    some penalty depending on the number of edges that they share with
    that node.

    Each round the choice is being made of the leaf nodes having the least
    path weight.

    The iterator works the following way:
        1) build the tree structure based on "tree" parameter supplied
            to the "__init__" method. "Tree" should be supplied as a
            multi-level nested sequence of type "list" or "tuple" where each
            level represent parent-child relationship in the resulting tree.
            Exapmle:
                [[1, 2], [3]]
                # root node has two children nodes, we'll call them A and B;
                # child node A has two leaves, 1 and 2;
                # child node B has one leaf, 3;
        2) at this moment all leaf nodes are considered equally good
            for selection (all path weights are zero), and iteration can be started;
        3) for example, call to method "next" gets you the value of 2.
            Iterator increases weights of the edges Root->A and A->2 by 1.
            Therefore, node with value 2 has path weight of 2 (1 for Root->A and 1 for A->2),
            and node with value 1 has path weight of 1 (1 for Root->A and 0 for A->1);
            node with value 3 still has path weight of 0.
        4) the next call to "next" will return 3 because it has the least path weight
            of 0; then its path weight will be increased to 2.
        5) now the node with value 1 has the least path weight of 1, so it will be returned
            on the next call.

    NOTE: default algorithm for selecting a leaf node among those having
        the least path weight is "random choice".
    NOTE: custom algorithm for selecting preferable leaf node among those having
        the least path weight can be supplied by the user to the "__init__" method.
        It should be a callable accepting iterable as input and
        returning back some element from this iterable.
    NOTE: the value returned from the "select" is compared by identity
        to elements from candidates list (i.e. using "is" operator).
        This means that it cannot distinguish between identical objects
        (e.g. using 'int' as leaf node values may cause side-effects).
